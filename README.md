## Beer Buddy

## Description
- Beer Buddy is a simple to use local brewery locator that finds all the breweries within the zip code searched. 
- For example: If you're in South Beach, Miami you'd input 33133 which would return all breweries listed in that zipcode.
- If no results are found for your zip code, the website then runs your state and returns an alphabetical list of breweries in the state.
-  For example: If you're in Beverly Hills, you'd input 90210 which would return all breweries in the state because there isn't one psecific to that area code 
- The response displays the brewery name, phone number, and a link to their website. 

## Roadmap
- In the future, we plan on adding a feature that allows you to teleport from wherever you are at that moment, to whichever brewery you select.
- This of course, once the technology is invented (:
